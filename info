Develop class Polynomial as follows:
1. It has one field representing the coefficients of the polynomial using an array of double. A polynomial is assumed to have the form 𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑥1 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑛−1𝑥𝑛−1. 
For example, the polynomial 6 − 2𝑥 + 5𝑥3 would be represented using the array [6, -2, 0, 5]
2. It has a no-argument constructor that sets the polynomial to zero (i.e. the corresponding array would be [0])
3. It has a constructor that takes an array of double as an argument and sets the coefficients accordingly
4. It has a method named add that takes one argument of type Polynomial and returns the polynomial resulting from adding the calling object and the argument
5. It has a method named evaluate that takes one argument of type double representing a value of x and evaluates the polynomial accordingly. For example,
if the polynomial is 6 − 2𝑥 + 5𝑥3 and evaluate(-1) is invoked, the result should be 3.
6. It has a method named hasRoot that takes one argument of type double and determines whether this value is a root of the polynomial or not. Note that a root
is a value of x for which the polynomial evaluates to zero.
